      Auctioning is a process of selling products in a special manner, instead of having one chance of profit from only one customer, the product is advertised to be sold competitively for the highest price, as well as any other life matter, auctions are now performed online, our mission is to create a sample of these online auction systems from A to Z. This report discusses our main ideas for this project, and gives a brief about our initial view how should it be planned and implemented and many other important points will be mentioned.
Our idea is based on the traditional idea of auctioning, but specified for cars auctioning, fetching some available digital functionalities which eases the use of the system making it user-friendly, an initial view for using the system can be described as follows:<br>
1. The user signs in for his account on the system, his role may be an admin or a customer.<br>
2. Only the main admin (GM) can add new admins.<br>
3. A product owner shall submit a detailed request for his product to be auctioned, the system admin revise his request and respond by either acceptance or refusal<br>
4. The system admin approves products requests to the owners and determine the min. available bidding difference and states the duration of the session in his approval if accepted, and checks the inventory balance, and states the unified system’s percentage on any sale.<br>
5. If the product is accepted, the owner chooses the suitable time for the auction session start.<br>
6. The customers’ main page of the system contains arranged announcements about the upcoming auction sessions, and can sort the viewed sessions in many various manners.<br>
7. The customer can subscribe for any announced session, and notified when it starts<br>
8. The customer’s profile is automatically synchronized with his bank account assuring that he has the cost of his bid, once he offer a bid, it’s cost is transferred from his account to the inventory of the system (and returned back later if he didn’t win the auction) (still under study).<br>
9. The session page shows the names of the participants, and the bids offered, and the highest bid.<br>
10. After the session ends, all participants are notified by the result, and the system transfers the cost to the owner’s account after deducting the system's percentage.
